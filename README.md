# -ReadyGo-Chess-Robot-project
The vision of CheckMates is to inspire the next generation of engineers and software developers through machine vision and play. READY GO consists of three major system components:  the machine learning model used to detect the pieces and board, the chess engine using the open-source engine called Stockfish, and the User Interface using python's Tkinter library.
